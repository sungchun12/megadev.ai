# Design Brainstorm

I want to build a static website with beautiful design.

General Design Considerations:
- #0047AB for the background
- Bluerpint lining
- modern retro aesthetic for the character model using the whip image for reference
- Made the character model blue where it's red
- Remove the hair
- I want the whip to have a side comment in blueprint spec typeface that explains what it does at a glance
- No scrolling, I want everything in a single page experience
- When I hover over the whip, it glows
- When I click on the whip, it will take me to github for: https://github.com/sungchun12/claiw


Tech considerations
- Can be easily deployed on hostinger
- React
- Nextjs or Vite?
- should python be involved at all?
- make it static or pre-rendered
