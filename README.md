Hey Y'all! 

I'm Sung.

I recently bought the domain above and want to research in the open what it means to be a megadev (heavily inspired by megaman). I predict that we will enter into the age of guilds (think: team composition meta) across startups and consultants. We're already seeing this with the job market zeitgeist in how the hottest startups are onboarding hires like [professional athletes](https://joincolossus.com/article/inside-cursor/) and [status engineering](https://www.humaninvariant.com/blog/titles). 

After witnessing the above role model stories take root, the general workforce will model after it with their own cultural power bottoms-up. It'll be through hyper-leverage tools and skills far beyond enmeshment with vendors (think: I know dbt, airflow, etc.). We're already seeing people leverage basic LLM chats as normal, simple agents, agentic workflows, and taking soft skills seriously (charisma and picking up idiosyncrasies are at a premium). The most effective players will build a blend of technical AND social/emotional tools: automation improvements tightly coupled with reading people, a higher standard of design, and social engineering.

I'll build these open tools best used by me, available for all. They will be tightly coupled to my physical existence: encrypted data, chat history, reinforecement learning, and knowing the [soul](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/claude-soul-document/) of the agents I build. I want you to fork and do the same. This isn't a novel prediction. These tools already exist in our gray matter. We now have the infrastructure to codify them.

I believe this will happen whether I'm a bystander or in the mess. 

I love a good mess.
