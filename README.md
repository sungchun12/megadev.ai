# megadev.ai

I recently bought the domain above and want to research in the open what it means to be a megadev. I predict that we will enter into the age of guilds (think: working with people you like with a cooler name). We're already seeing this with the job market zeitgeist in how the hottest startups are drafting hires like professional athletes and [status engineering](https://www.humaninvariant.com/blog/titles). I imagine a world where the general workforce will create their own cultural power bottoms-up through hyper-leverage tools and skills. Some people are relying on hyperscaler-provided AI tools, simple agents, agentic workflows, and taking soft skills seriously through the "I quit big tech to influencer pipeline". What people are missing is a blend of technical AND social/emotional tools required to succeed in the new world order. This is where I aim to gamify this cultural trend by evolving my career persona beyond my LinkedIn profile. It'll live as tools best used by me, available to be used by all and in the open. Only I can use them to their full power because they will have private data rooted in local-first experiences. This means the tools you want me to use to solve your problems are tightly coupled to my physical existence (think: encrypted data, chat history, reinforecement learning, knowing the [soul](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/claude-soul-document/) of the agents I build).
